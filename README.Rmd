<!-- badges: end -->

`mmrefpoints` is an R package that generates marine mammal population projections based on starting abundance, life history, and bycatch rates, based on the BALEEN II population dynamics model.

## Need
Stakeholders involved in the management of marine mammal bycatch in marine fisheries need tools to simulate the effects of management decisions on marine mammal populations. Population models are a key part of this process. This package contains the tools to simulate marine mammal populations and an app that shows model outputs in a user-friendly way.

## Details
This R package contains the functions used in the Marine Mammal Bycatch Impacts Exploration Tool (MMBIET), a Shiny app built by Margaret Siple, André Punt, and the Ocean Modeling Forum's [Marine Mammal Bycatch Working Group](https://oceanmodelingforum.org/working-groups/marine-mammal-bycatch-working-group/). 

The functions in this package, and the Shiny app, are intended to be used in cases where data on bycatch and/or population status are sparse or unavailable. 

Our target audience is stakeholders interested in projecting marine mammal populations to examine the impacts of bycatch. Those code could also be used as a teaching tool, or for anyone who is more familiar with R than FORTRAN and wants to use some components of the BALEEN II model (Punt 1999).

## Installation
This package can be downloaded directly from GitHub:

```
devtools::install_github("mcsiple/mmrefpoints")
```

* NOTE: For Linux users, if you run into an error about the `magick` package, try installing `magick` first using the instructions [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

### Community guidelines
We would like this package to be sustainable in the long term and welcome contributions. If you are interested in contributing, please check out our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/mcsiple/mmrefpoints/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

Bugs and enhancements are tracked through GitHub issues. If you have a bug to report, there is a [bug report template](https://github.com/mcsiple/mmrefpoints/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to help maximize the benefit of your report for everyone. The same goes for requests for [enhancements](https://github.com/mcsiple/mmrefpoints/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md). 





## Accessing the MMBIET Shiny app
The functions in this package can also be accessed through the Shiny app for this project, which is located online [here](https://msiple.shinyapps.io/mmrefpoints/). The app provides an easy way to explore outcomes and print out a report with inputs and outputs. 

The mmBIET Shiny app can also be accessed through the R package:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(mmrefpoints)
run_app()
```

## Functionality

The foundation of this package is an age-structured population projection model with bycatch mortality. Key functions in this package:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
x <- data.frame("Function" = c("dynamics()",
                               "projections()"),
                "Purpose" = c("Generate a single trajectory for marine mammal population size", 
                              "Generate several trajectories for marine mammal population size"))

knitr::kable(x)
```



To create a single projection for a marine mammal population, use the `dynamics()` function:
```{r message=FALSE}
x <- mmrefpoints::dynamics(lh.params = list(S0 = 0.944, S1plus = 0.99, 
                           K1plus = 9000, AgeMat = 17, z = 2.39, nages = 25, lambdaMax = 1.04),
                           InitDepl = 0.6, 
                           ConstantCatch = NA, 
                           ConstantF = rep(0.01, times = 100), 
                           nyears = 100)
plot(1:100, x$TotalPop, type = 'l', xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population size")
```

Variation in the model is introduced through variation in bycatch mortality over time and uncertainty in the estimate of starting abundance.

```{r message=FALSE}
x <- mmrefpoints::projections(
  NOut = 1,
  ConstantBycatch = list(Catch = 50, CV = 0.7),
  InitDepl = 0.6,
  lh.params = list(
    S0 = 0.944, S1plus = 0.99,
    K1plus = 9000, AgeMat = 18, nages = 25, z = 2.39, lambdaMax = 1.04
  ),
  nyears = 100, obs_CV = 0.1
)

# One trajectory with bycatch uncertainty and an observation CV:
plot(x$trajectories, type = "l", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population size")
```

Projections shown in the app are based on simulation parameters provided by the user. They include a "high", "medium", and "low" bycatch level based on a user-determined range. 

```{r message=FALSE}
x_lo <- mmrefpoints::projections(
  NOut = 100,
  ConstantBycatch = list(Catch = 0, CV = 0),
  InitDepl = 0.6,
  lh.params = list(
    S0 = 0.944, S1plus = 0.99,
    K1plus = 9000, AgeMat = 18, nages = 25, z = 2.39, lambdaMax = 1.04
  ),
  nyears = 100, obs_CV = 0.1
)

x_med <- mmrefpoints::projections(
  NOut = 100,
  ConstantBycatch = list(Catch = 50, CV = 0.7),
  InitDepl = 0.6,
  lh.params = list(
    S0 = 0.944, S1plus = 0.99,
    K1plus = 9000, AgeMat = 18, nages = 25, z = 2.39, lambdaMax = 1.04
  ),
  nyears = 100, obs_CV = 0.1
)

x_hi <- mmrefpoints::projections(
  NOut = 100,
  ConstantBycatch = list(Catch = 200, CV = 0.7),
  InitDepl = 0.6,
  lh.params = list(
    S0 = 0.944, S1plus = 0.99,
    K1plus = 9000, AgeMat = 18, nages = 25, z = 2.39, lambdaMax = 1.04
  ),
  nyears = 100, obs_CV = 0.1
)

mmrefpoints::plot_proj(high = x_hi,
                       med = x_med,
                       low = x_lo,
                       years.plot = 100,
                       ylims = c(0, 9000),
                       K1plus = 9000)
```
